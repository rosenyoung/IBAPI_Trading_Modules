# IBAPI_Trading_Modules
This modules are a simple trading system based on Interactive Brokers API. I will compelete it gradually.

DataAPI can acquire historical and real-time 5 second bar data and save the data into mysql database. You should have set a mysql database before using this API. Do not forget to change the database connection parameters before connecting.
Orders.py is not compeleted now
